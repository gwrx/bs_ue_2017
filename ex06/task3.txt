They offer a slightly different interface to those tools, but the basic concepts are the same. One notable difference is that POSIX offers some notification features for message queues that Sys V does not. (See mq_notify().)

System V is way older than POSIX - therefore a lot of programs still use the System V Interface. Posix tried to unify all the UNIX Systems to build a common platform for interprocess stuff (communication, signals etc.). Both are doing essentially the same thing, thus posix tried to serve an implementation simpler to use.
Also, POSIX is atomic with some operations, where SysV is not.
